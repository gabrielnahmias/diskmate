DiskMate
=============

**DiskMate** is a **PHP _script_** that gives disk usage information about any directoriy on a web server.

What does it do?
-----------

* Gives you disk usage information about whatever folder you'd like on your web server (as dictated by the `DOCUMENT_ROOT`).
* Provides a simple password system (you can change this in `config.php`).  You can also set to be remembered for 30 days.
* Gets the boss off your back light _**that!**_

How to use it
-----------

Upload it or otherwise store it on a server with at least PHP5 installed and visit the page!  I will add more information about the `GET` options you can set once I add programmatical output like in Canommonon.  For now, just use the interface.
